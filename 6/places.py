'''6.9. Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places.
Think of three names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to 
three favorite places for each person. To make this exercise a bit more 
interesting, ask some friends to name a few of their favorite places.
Loop through the dictionary, and print each personâ€™s name and their 
favorite places'''
